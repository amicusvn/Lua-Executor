# If your executor not working


**Window defender**
- usually Window defender just turn on itself so go to Window security and check if real time security is disable

**not injecting even though real time is disable**
- go to this The Ugly Gamer's discord server, to get the new api , heres his Youtube channel : [Ugly gamer's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@theuglygamer098/videos)

- extract the file, then go to the file "VIDEO FILES!! XENO" -> "XenoStuff"
- copy all of the thing in the file
- go back to Lua Executor -> bin -> Debug -> net 8.0-windows
- then paste the things you just copied -> press replace
- ur done now enjoy doing stuff

# Some information
**This is a keyless executor with simple ui, suitable for exploiting if ur computer is weak**
1. I dont download any nuggets or suspicious files, everything is already in the Visual Studio 2022 Toolbox
2. this project is meant to be light with only 8.8mb
3. this is my hobby and this is not a rat or trojan or whatever. if you dont trust this then dont download it
4. I dont need any support call me skid or whatever idc
5. its calling you tester because this is actually the test version made for testers

# Important stuff
**It will create a new .txt file everytime you inject**
- .txt files cant harm your computer , everytime you inject it will create a .txt file / it use to identify what script do you use and stuff (most of the time its useless so i reccommened you deleting it if you want)
- ofc you can delete it, just go to the logs foler in net8.0 folder
- you can reinstall the executor like normal but heres some extra steps to save some data
1. window + R -> appdata
2. go to Local
3. find Xeno -> Delete it or save it for your next use idc
